# PP2 Assembler

This is an assembler for the Practicum Processor 2 (PP2 for short), which was in
use by the Computer Systems (2ic30) course (and possibly others) at Eindhoven
University of Technology.

The assembler provided by the course organisation has an annoying bug, which
this assembler will try to fix. I would have fixed it in their assembler, but
unfortunately, it's not open source.
