# assembler-pp2
This is an assembler for the Practicum Processor 2 (PP2 for short), which is in use by the Computer Systems course (and possibly others). The assembler provided by the course organisation has an annoying bug, which this assembler will try to fix. I would have fixed it in their assembler, but unfortunately, it's not open source. Oh well, I guess you can't have everything.
